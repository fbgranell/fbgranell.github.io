I have two years of experience working in marketing analytics. I build models to measure campaign impact, optimize media spend, improve customer targeting and more. My background in physics and strong coding skills help me work efficiently with large, messy datasets and deliver clear, data-driven insights.

I’ve developed models for Marketing Mix Modeling, discount optimization, and user scoring, and regularly apply statistical methods like control group analysis and clustering. In my free time, I’ve also trained AI models for computer vision using convolutional neural networks, and built neural networks from scratch using only NumPy matrices for learning purposes.

You can find some of my personal projects <a href='/projects/'>here</a>.

**Main technologies:** Python, SQL, Google Cloud Console, Deep Learning,  Machine Learning, Tableau, Web Scraping, R, Azure, BigQuery, Workflows, Cloud Run, Tensorflow, PyTorch, Marketing Mix Modelling

**Hobbies**: I’m passionate about video games and enjoy both competitive and cooperative play. I’ve reached high ranks (Grandmaster, Master, and Diamond) in titles like League of Legends, Overwatch, and Marvel Rivals. I also take part in Mythic+ dungeons and raids in World of Warcraft, where teamwork and strategy are key.
